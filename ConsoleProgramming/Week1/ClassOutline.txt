Class Outline: 
Start with PPT to introduce C# and what they will be able to do.
A) Start a new Project:
  1. File -> New -> Project
  2. Under Visual C# select "Console App (.NET Core)"
  3. Change name to "SKILLsConsole" (Note that this name can be whatever fits your project but this is what we will be   using in this course).
B) First Program
  4. Discuss Elements on screen. Discribe what each does 
  5. Introduce Commenting.
  6. This creates "Hello World" Program.  Run this program with play button. 
  7. Console appears and dissappaers. Use Console.ReadKey() to pause output. 
  8. add user instructions before console.readkey
C) Differnt approaches
  9. Hello world as seperate method
  10. Hello world as string method 
D) Create new Class
  11. Copy in Hello world
  12. How can we call this? note that since it is private by default you cannot
  13. Introduce private/public/protected (can be called from derived classes) distinction
E) Change text color and position
  14.Change text color
  15. Change text position
  16. Note that decisions must be made because during program run these settings stick.
F) If time: Have them draw something with a program. 
E) Introduce Console.ReadLine()
  11. This is thier homework: Create a program that can read in user input and then write it to the console. It only needs to do this once. It should exit cleanly.
